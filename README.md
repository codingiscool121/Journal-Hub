# Journal-Hub
A place where you can write public entries about your life.
How it works:
1) First of all, you have to sign up for Journal Hub. This is a feature that isn't available right now, but will be very soon.
2) Once you get in, there will be a page where you can write your entry, and a page where you can read other people's entries.

To run:
1) Run npm install --global expo-cli.
2) Run npm install firebase.
3) You should be good to go!
